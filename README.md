# Test for JSPM, Angular2 with Visual Studio Code using Typescript
This is a test project to setup Angular2 with JSPM.
Note that this is a personal project for educational purposes.

# Getting Started
- To start clone the repo, and run `npm install` then run `jspm install`
- Then run `npm run tsc`. 
This will compile the TypeScript files, and watch for changes.
- In a seperate terminal window run `npm run start`. This will start up a local live-server instance and open your browser to the demo page.
